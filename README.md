### Problems to be solved :

When clicking in an answer or entering an answer on the input field 
    [ ] TIMER GOES CRAZY, even goes to negative numbers.
    [ ] RANDOM SCORE GOES CRAZY, renders several scores then stops.

    - if no answer is selected, TIMER and SCORE work as expected.

[ ] When writting an answer in the input field, if the next question has an input field : THE PREVIOUS ANSWER DOES NOT GET CLEARED.

[ ] At the end a RANDOM LITTLE NUMBER its printed on the left middle section of the quiz-container.


### Requirements

[x] questions pass automatically after timer ends or after an answer is selected/inputed.
[x] at the end of the quiz, content vanishes and only the video stays looping.
[x] theres 4 parts, after each part a partial score will be displayed.
[x] the score will be random selected from a list of scores.
